# gerald
it's gerald!

gerald will randomly choose which stat in dark souls to level. 

enter at command line from the working directory (windows):

	py stats.py

he will ask how many levels, and when you enter an integer he will spit out the answer in the output file 'output-stats.txt'

this can be loaded into twitch by creating a text box with the source file as 'output-stats.txt'
