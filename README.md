# gerald
it's gerald! there are a number of word lists that are pulled in by sentence.py and randomly chosen
it's a longer script with a lot of repetition, so some of it breaks, especially some of the specific rules
current version is v3 (what is uploaded now).
integration into twitch is easy if you just open a text box and select the source from file to be 'sentenceout.txt', at which point you can just run the script and it will populate
py sentence.py
