gerald randomly chooses words from the associated word lists (.txt files) to construct one of 11 randomly chosen sentence patterns.

current version is v7 (as of 20-Dec-2021).

integration into twitch via text box source file = 'what-out.txt'.

just run the script either by command line from the working directory (windows):

	py what.py

or by having python installd (I used 3.8.6) and double-clicking the file what.py

or by opening what.py in the python IDLE an running it
