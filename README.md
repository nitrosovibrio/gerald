# gerald
it's gerald!
there are a couple aspects of gerald, with branches devoted to each.

one is his language skills.

another is his Dark Souls Class/Gift choosing.

the final for now is his Dark Souls Leveling.

download the appropriate files and run from python. versions shouldn't matter, they only use base python.
the language and dark souls start files are just modules

to integrate into twitch you only need to set up a text source and click to use a file as the source, and make that file the output file you see in the code. 

more details in each branch readme

have fun!
