# gerald
it's gerald!
there are a couple aspects of gerald.

one is his language skills.

another is his Dark Souls Class/Gift choosing.

the final for now is his Dark Souls Leveling.

download the appropriate files and run from python. versions shouldn't matter, they only use base python.
the language and dark souls start files are just modules, you can run them by typing "py dsstart.py" or "py sentence.py" from the command line. the stats module ("py stats.py") will prompt for input of the number of levels needed, and once you return an integer gerald will pick that many stats to level. 

to integrate into twitch you only need to set up a text source and click to use a file as the source, and make that file the output file you see in the code. have fun!
